      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p className="paragraph tl mh4">
        I am a hardworking and ambitious individual with a great passion for
        Software Engineering and I am a recent graduate of Southampton Solent
        University. I have strong IT technical skills as well as excellent
        interpersonal skills, from my previous role as a data entry for 3 years.
        In this role, I have dealt with customer inquiries face-to-face, over
        the phone, and via email, in some cases multi-tasking to ensure the best
        customer service experience. Furthermore, ensuring accurate information
        is up to date on our systems. My excellent customer service and
        communication skills, combined with my IT skills, make me a real asset
        to any company looking for a candidate with such abilities.
      </p>
      <h4>Skill Overview</h4>
      <p className="paragraph tl mh4">
        To forge my programming prowess, I have built several different projects
        utilizing my core skills. My strength lay in front-end development, with
        a good understanding of HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript. I have also
        solidified these skills by finishing a popular web development Bootcamp
        on Udemy by Andrei Neagoie, which focused on HTML, CSS, and Javascript,
        as well as React and NodeJS. It's not the only course on Udemy I have
        taken and it is not the last. I will continue to build my skills in any
        way I can to achieve my goal of one day becoming a well-renowned and
        fulfilled programmer. The course by Andrei also helped me build my Web
        development guide, with helpful tips and tricks I use as a cheat sheet.
      </p>
      <h4>Other Experience</h4>
      <p className="paragraph tl mh4">
        My skills do not only revolve around front-end programming, I have used
        a variety of languages to build a wide range of projects, including
        mobile application, Backend programming, and analysis of data using
        machine learning. I also have a good understanding and experience of
        deploying websites with Docker and Docker-Compose on Azure servers. All
        projects I have discussed can be found in the project section of this
        website or on my GitHub.
      </p>
      <h4>My Next Step</h4>
      <p className="paragraph tl mh4">
        My next step is to kick off my programming career. I hope to find an
        employer who can give me the chance to show them how valuable of an
        asset I can be. I know I am not the most experienced programmer, but I
        am the most dedicated to continuing to learn and improve in any way I
        can. I am not too shy to ask for help, but I will not need to be
        micromanaged at every step. I understand that a good programmer is not
        someone who knows everything, but rather someone who can solve any
        problem, and that is the type of programmer I wish to be. If an employer
        is reading this I would ask that you allow me to meet you face to face,
        so I can further prove my value.
